# Kaggle-PortoSeguro
### About the project

This repository contains the script for machine learning competition, hosted on [Kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/c/porto-seguro-safe-driver-prediction). 
More info about the competition and the host can be found there.

Currently, I've added one R script in this repository which is up-and-running (after you download the data set and change the path of working directory!).

There are two versions of the same R script:
	1) .Rmd file
	2) .html file
	
**.Rmd** file will only show the R - code. To see the code and its output, open --> download --> save --> open the **.html** file.

There are a couple of important plots which are not clearly visible even in the .html file. I've added those plots separately in the **Analysis/** .
