# Kaggle-PortoSeguro
### About the project

This repository contains the script for machine learning competition, hosted on [Kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/c/porto-seguro-safe-driver-prediction). 
More info about the competition and the host can be found there.

Currently, I've added one R script in this repository which is up-and-running (after you download the data set and change the path of working directory!).
